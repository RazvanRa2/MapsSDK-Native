Welcome to the Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS!

> The SDK for Android and iOS is currently available as a developer preview.  Although we encourage you to try out the SDK in your own
prototype code now, we caution the use in production code at this time.
>
> Feature requests and bug reports are very much welcome at the [issues page](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Native/issues).
Your insights and scenarios are critically important to us.


# Overview
The **Bing Maps SDK for Android** and **Bing Maps SDK for iOS** are libraries for building mapping applications for Android and iOS.
The SDKs feature a native map control and an accompanying map services API set.

The map control is powered by a full vector 3D map engine with [a number of standard mapping capabilities](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Native/wiki/Concepts_Table)
including displaying icons, drawing polylines and polygons, and overlaying texture sources.  This engine brings in the same 3D Native
support you know from our [XAML Map Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/index) in Windows 10, including
worldwide 3D elevation data (via our Digital Elevation Model).

The native controls and map services API set will continue to mature and stabilize in future SDK releases!
